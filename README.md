### Features ###
- Optional live-reload environment in gulp
- Easy and declarative folder structure 
- Modifiable build code

- Material-UI `@next` and JSS fully supported
- Minimal express server which supports easy switch between HTTP/HTTPS

### Roadmap ###

- Create meaningful README.md to put here for installation/use

- Add template content to `modules/core/components/MainApp`
- Fill in certain Webpack features such as CSS imports
