A modular, clean and modern workflow template for React/Redux development

### Features ###
- Optional live-reload environment
- Easy and declarative folder structure 
- Easily modifiable build code written in gulp; no magical configuration
- Modular React/Redux architecture which lend themselves well to unit testing
- Material-UI `@next` and JSS fully supported
- Minimal express server which supports easy switching between HTTP/HTTPS
- Redux and Redux-Router (both `@ next`)
- Flags for giving OS notices when builds are successful or not

### Roadmap ###

- Create meaningful README.md to put here for installation/use
- Trim a few unnecessary build packages for template's npm dependencies
- Remove auto SemVer patch # version bumps in build that were specific to a personal project workflow
- Add template content to `modules/core/components/MainApp`
- Fill in actual commonly used Webpack features such as CSS imports
- Create a separate generator to make **material-ui** and associated fonts/files optional

### Important Note ###
This repo is a work in progress; it has been put on NPM simply to test Yeoman's 
package system. Please keep that in mind.
