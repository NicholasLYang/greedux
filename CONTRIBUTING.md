## Contributing ##

First, I'd really like to start off by thank you for considering contributing to this repo. Since it is still actively growing and being developed, the rules aren't quite as strict as you may find in many more popular development tool libraries. With that said, please be sure to briefly look over the following points



### Issues ###

Issues or feature requests are welcome, but please be sure to be descriptive in your issue title and especially in the description. If you would like to submit a feature request, those are welcome as well. Just please prefix that with something to the effect of this if it is the case.



### Code Style and Consistency ###

While linting on the React/JS side of things is on the Roadmap, there are several different paradigms used here. Please do your best to follow the consistent formatting given within the repo at the point where you are making a contribution.



### Branches ### 

The naming for branches is not very particular, but if possible please prefix that with `refactor/`, `fix/` or `feature` according to the intention of the branch.



### License ###

Please note that any work on or forked from this repo would also adhere to the MIT license as stated in the package file (and in addition to any licenses in the packages used by this repo)
